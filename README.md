# EAminimo2

The EETAC wants to offer a new service to campus to allow their members to share electrical
bikes.
For this reason, it requests that EA students build a new service with the following features:
- Get information about stations
- Manage the available bikes in a Station
The set of decisions that define the proposed architectural style are the following:
- The database (mongodb) must store the information entities
- The application must be implemented as a hybrid app ( IONIC !!! )
- Restful API implemented using nodeJS and express
- The figure below shows the views and actions to develop



Funciona todo
